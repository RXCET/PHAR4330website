  <h2><u>Alligation Method</u></h2>
 <p>Just like Algebraic method,<span><i> Alligation Alternate Method </i></span>can be used for calculating strength of a solution obtained by mixing 2 or more solutions of
 different strengths. It is a visual method for computing proportions</p>

               <p>Steps:</p>
               <ol>
                <li>Make a tic-tac-toe grid.</li>
                <li>Enter the percentage strength of the higher strength solution in the upper left box.</li>
                <li>Enter the percentage strength of the lower strength solution in the lower left box.</li>
                <li>Enter the desired percentage strength in the center box.</li>
                <li>X is the unknown amount of higher strength solution to be mixed to obtain the desired strength.</li>
                <li>Y is the unknown amount of lower strength solution to be mixed to obtain the desired strength.</li>
                <li>Subtract B from C to solve for X.</li>
                <li>Subtract C from A to solve for Y.</li>
                <li>You will need X parts of A and Y parts of B to make X + Y parts of C.</li>
                <li>To convert parts to an actual volume amount, calculate as follows:
                <div class = "formulae"><p>$$ Volume \ of \ Solution \ A = { x \ part \over x + y \ parts} \times desired \ volume \ of \ Solution \ C $$</p></div>
                <div class = "formulae"><p>$$ Volume \ of \ Solution \ B = { x \ part \over x + y \ parts} \times desired \ volume \ of \ Solution \ C $$</p></div>
                </li>
                <li>Check your answer by adding the volume of solution A and the volume of solution B. The total should be the desired volume of solution C.</li>
               </ol>

              <p>Letâ€™s solve a problem using alligation method, which was solved earlier using the algebraic method.</p>
