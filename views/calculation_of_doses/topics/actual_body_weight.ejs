    <h2><u>Drug Dosage Based on Adjusted Body Weight</u></h2>
                <p><i>Adjusted Body Weight</i> is also used for determining drug dosage for some medications. 
                Adjusted body weight (IBW<sub>adj</sub>) is an adjusted version of IBW. The rationale for using IBW<sub>adj</sub> 
                is that people above IBW may have a certain percentage of excess weight as lean muscle mass as compared to individuals at IBW. 
                For certain medications IBW<sub>ad</sub> is used if the ABW is 125% of IBW.

                <p>
                    Calculation of IBW<sub>adj</sub> is performed by first determining IBW, calculating the difference between ABW and IBW, 
                    multiplying the difference between ABW and IBW with a correction factor, usually 10, 20, 25 or a 40 %.  Some common equations used to calculate IBW<sub>adj</sub> are:

                                     A physician writes the following order: gentamicin 1.5 mg/kg/dose q8h for a 33-year old man who is 190 kg 
                                     and 70 inches tall. Gentamicin is a medication dosed based on IBW, however, if a patient is above 125% of their IBW, it is recommended that Gentamicin should be dosed using adjusted body weight with a dose correction factor of 0.4. Calculate the dose of gentamicin for the patient per day.</p>
